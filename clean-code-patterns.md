# Clean Code Patterns

While creational, structural and behavioral pattern help us to solve specific problems, clean code patterns help us to produce code that is readable, easily understandable and easy to change. Some of them are called low-level refactoring patterns but some are rather ideas and principles to examine and be inspired by.

Clean code patterns are activities that are supposed to be done continuously over the time. Clean code patterns become are supposed to become a good habit, rather than one time solution for a problem.

This category of design patterns is based on the following points:

> 1. Remove duplication.  
> 2. Simplify your code.  
> 3. Clarify you code’s intent.

There is a subtle difference between code which is new, the code which is new and kept refactored and code that nobody every did refactor over many years. 

With this chapter, I hope to provide more insight on how to make code that does not rot.
