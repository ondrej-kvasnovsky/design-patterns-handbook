# Builder

The main reason to use Builder pattern is to avoid constructors with huge amount of parameters. Some people say we should have a limit for number of parameters and it should be around 3 parameters per constructor. We should keep the number parameters  around 3 because if not, it is becoming a piece of code that is difficult to read and manage. People who developed feelings for a code, might say that constructors with many parameters are ugly and not friendly.
