# Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are to ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

Adapter

* Match interfaces of different classes

Composite

* A tree structure of simple and composite objects

Proxy

* An object representing another object

Flyweight

* A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

Facade

* A single class that represents an entire subsystem

Bridge

* Separates an object's interface from its implementation

Decorator

* Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

Private Class Data

* Restricts accessor/mutator access
