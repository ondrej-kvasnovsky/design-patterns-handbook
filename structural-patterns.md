# Structural Patterns

Structural patterns are to ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships between entities.

[Adapter](/structural-patterns/adapter.md)

* Match interfaces of different classes

[Composite](/structural-patterns/composite.md)

* A tree structure of simple and composite objects

[Proxy](/structural-patterns/proxy.md)

* An object representing another object

[Flyweight](/structural-patterns/flyweight.md)

* A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

[Facade](/structural-patterns/facade.md)

* A single class that represents an entire subsystem

[Bridge](/structural-patterns/bridge.md)

* Separates an object's interface from its implementation

[Decorator](/structural-patterns/decorator.md)

* Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

[Private Class Data](/structural-patterns/private-class-data.md)

* Restricts accessor/mutator access
